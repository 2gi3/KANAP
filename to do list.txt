● From a technical perspective the cart can be made as an array
containing three things: - the product ID, - the quantity of the
product, - the colour of the product.
● You must use LocalStorage to access this array from the product
page.
● When you add a product to the cart for the first time, add a new
element to the array.
● When you add the same product to the cart (the same product ID
and the same colour), increase the quantity of the product in the
array.
⚠️ Issues to be aware of:
● In LocalStorage take care to avoid having several of the same
elements for no reason
